# Explanation

Advent of Code (AOC) is an independent programming project designed to aid in practicing many software engineering techniques. There is a unique puzzle every day of the month leading up to Christmas, and they can be written in any programming language. During the first few days of AOC 2024, I worked through a series of challenges that emphasized problem-solving and logical thinking. Completing these challenges reinforced core programming practices such as breaking problems into smaller components, testing solutions with example inputs, and refining logic through iteration. The exercises also provided practice in debugging and validating assumptions, which are essential skills for writing reliable code.

# My Experience

I wrote my code in C++, gaining experience in a valuable career-important language. Overall, Advent of Code served as a practical way to strengthen algorithmic thinking and develop disciplined coding habits. In addition, the iterative nature of solving and refining solutions encouraged persistence and adaptability when faced with unfamiliar problems. Regularly debugging, testing, and improving my approach strengthened my ability to reason through complex systems and write reliable code, which are essential skills for collaborating on larger projects and succeeding in a software engineering role.
