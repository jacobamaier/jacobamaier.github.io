  Last week, we began learning about Typescript in my ICS 314 class. Compared to some other programming classes I’ve had recently, Typescript was easy for me to become comfortable with. I have some experience with Javascript from my middle school coding club, which certainly helped. This is a reminder that any experience with or exposure to programming, even 5+ years ago, can make learning and writing code that much easier.
	Compared to the other languages I’ve been working with, C++ and Java, I don’t particularly like Typescript that much. C++ and Java give finer control, with stricter rules that help the code feel more organized. That doesn’t mean that Typescript doesn’t have its uses, as it seems to be light enough to run quickly in a web environment and has many web development applications.
	We also began practicing Athletic Software Engineering. This is a pedagogy that prioritizes speed and efficiency with respect to completing programming assignments. This is beneficial in helping us practice for timed technical interviews, which can be very stressful. However, while this can help us land a job, I don’t find it very applicable to our actual career. Technical interviews are important tools for recruiters to ensure that applicants are familiar with their language and work well under stress, but the main duties within the job are going to be much slower paced and careful programming to prevent bugs. I don’t particularly like the Workout of the Day (WOD) learning environment, and I feel that practicing them twice a week is much less beneficial to our careers in Computer Science than experience working slower on larger projects as part of a team. With that being said, I appreciate the experience, as it will help me work better under stress and within a time constraint, as I will likely do in technical interviews. I am looking forward to learning as much as I can in ICS 314, and becoming more prepared for my career in the field of Computer Science.
